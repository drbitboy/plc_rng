RNG for MicroLogix 1100 series PLC, developed using [RSLogix Micro Starter Light].

Relies on MicroLogix layout (status bits, etc.), and uses a 15-bit Random Number Generator.

N.B. Gaussian distribution via Box-Muller Transform is implemented but untested; by visual inspection the values look reasonable.
